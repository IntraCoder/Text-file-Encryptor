# Text-file-Encryptor
before Downloading ,install  cryptography module by 
"pip install cryptography" commmand in cmd


I have added a key file for u to use. 
but i want u to generate your own key and save it in secure place.

To use GUI encryptor ,make sure to download all the files
To use CLI encryptor ,just fileencryptor_CLI.py file can work alone.
